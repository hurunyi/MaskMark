# Mask Image Watermarking

Official implementation of [Mask Image Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12739).

## üîó Model Weights

We provide pre-trained model weights for inference. You can download them from the following link: **[Download Model Weights](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark)**.

Specifically, the following two variants are available:

- **[D_32bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/D_32bits.pth?download=true), [D_64bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/D_64bits.pth?download=true), [D_128bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/D_128bits.pth?download=true)** ‚Äì for global watermark embedding with different bits.
- **[ED_32bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/ED_32bits.pth?download=true), [ED_64bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/ED_64bits.pth?download=true), [ED_128bits](https://huggingface.co/Runyi-Hu/MaskMark/resolve/main/ED_128bits.pth?download=true)** ‚Äì for adaptive local watermark embedding based on the mask with different bits.

After downloading, place the weights into the `checkpoints/` directory.

## üöÄ Inference

### MaskMark-D

```bash
python3 inference.py \
    --device "cuda:0" \
    --model_name "D_32bits" \
    --image_name "00"
```

This command performs the following steps:

1. **Global Watermark Embedding.** A full-image watermark is embedded into the specified image.

2. **Masked Fusion.** Using a predefined mask, only the masked region retains the watermark, while the rest of the image is replaced by the original image. This creates a fused image that contains both watermarked and clean areas.

3. **Watermark Localization & Extraction.** The model then performs watermark localization and extraction on the fused image.

All results will be saved in the `results/D_32bits` directory.

### MaskMark-ED

```bash
python3 inference.py \
    --device "cuda:0" \
    --model_name "ED_32bits" \
    --image_name "00"
```
Unlike **MaskMark-D**, this command enables adaptive **local** watermark embedding during generation. The watermark is primarily embedded within the mask-selected region, while the rest of the image is designed to contain minimal or no watermark signal.

All results will be saved in the `results/ED_32bits` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Training
Training code will be released in a future update. Stay tuned!
